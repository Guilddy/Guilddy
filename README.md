# Guilddy

Guilddy is a Discord bot that helps Discord server owners and moderators in day-to-day tasks.

![Node.js CI](https://github.com/JDThralls/Guilddy/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg) [![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FJDThralls%2FGuilddy.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FJDThralls%2FGuilddy?ref=badge_shield)

## Features

Guilddy has features specific to games or game genres, but also yields some game-agnostic features.

The bot is currently in a planning stage before the first sprint. There will be no information here until we actually implement features.

Depending on the situation, we will add features to this list after we added them to the bot and progress as we go.

Documentation for the bot's features, even if they are not found here is being updated with the features themselves in their respective spot in the documentation files (Link will be added after first sprint).

## Contribution

Contribution is currently closed. At some point, we will release the contribution guidelines and open contributions to the open source community.
