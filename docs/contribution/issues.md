## Issue Types

### Feature Requests

Request a feature you want to see in the bot and/or web interface or an enhancement to an existing feature by filling out our issue template `Feature Request`. This way your proposal can be evaluated and maybe put onto our roadmap.

### Bug Reports

Report a bug, problem, misbehaviour with either our publicly hosted instance or your self-hosted instance and help us do better. Fill out our `Bug Report` issue template if you are using our instance or our `Bug Report (Self-Hosted)` issue template if you are hosting your own instance. This way we can look into your issue and find out wether we can reproduce it and improve the system.

## Tags and Releases

The master branch is where all contributions go. For that reason, tags are used to mark releases. There are 2 types of releases:

- a release tagged `vX.X.X` is a stable version and is deployed to the stable environment
- a release tagged `vX.X.X-rcX` is a release candidate and is deployed to the edge environment
