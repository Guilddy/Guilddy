## Issue Types

### Feature Requests

Request a feature you want to see in the bot and/or web interface or an enhancement to an existing feature by filling out our issue template `Feature Request`. This way your proposal can be evaluated and maybe put onto our roadmap.

### Bug Reports

Report a bug, problem, misbehaviour with either our publicly hosted instance or your self-hosted instance and help us do better. Fill out our `Bug Report` issue template if you are using our instance or our `Bug Report (Self-Hosted)` issue template if you are hosting your own instance. This way we can look into your issue and find out wether we can reproduce it and improve the system.
